# H1Board
## Introduction
With more and more people coming from foreign countries to the U.S for higher education and career development, H1B visa lottery and approval stats become a popular topic among more people every year. Unfortunately, obtaining proper work authorization through an H1-B visa can be a challenge for many international employees. As international students, we want to help our peers to obtain more insights into the influencing factors for the H1-B application process, especially on the visa approval rate, and also make proper recommendations on companies based on factors including but not limited to employee reviews, H1-B sponsorship, locations, salaries, etc.. The datasets we chose include various information, such as approval status and information of employees who applied for H1-B visa, along with employer information, work location, salary ranges, job title, etc.. We hope to combine and analyze the datasets, to learn more about what are the common factors that might influence the H1-B approval rate, which employees provide a friendly working environment for international workers, and if possible make recommendations for job-seeking international students based on our analysis results.
